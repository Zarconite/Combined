# Combined

Everything apart from People and Minesweeper are 100% working. I'm aware I could optimize some of my codes to be a bit better, in particular minesweeper.

Minesweeper does work, however if the grid size isn't perfectly square, there's an out of bounds error (Something I need to look into). Also, I could probably get away with using one or two for loops instead.
